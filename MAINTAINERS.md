This document outlines some of the process

## Publishing

- This project uses the auto shipit `next` [branching strategy](https://intuit.github.io/auto/docs/generated/shipit#next-branch-default). All prs should be merged into `next` by default.
- To release a new version on npm that is tagged with `latest`, [open a PR from next to stable](https://github.com/hydrosquall/storybook-addon-datadog-rum/compare/stable...next?expand=1).
